## Personal Interests :
* Python Programming
* AWS
* Watching Soccer (I used to say it as football but I'm adapting to the USA!)

# Technical Background :
I gained programming experience during my Bachelor's in Computer Science courses and also gained practical knowledge during my interships where I was working as a mobile application developer, blockchain developer and network architect across three different organizations. I am looking to learn more during my Master's degree and looking to improve!

## My favorite meme is THIS
