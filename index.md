* As part of our team term project for CIS641, we are developing a ride share mobile application for students. This app really helps students who are new to the city, who does not own a car for travel, they can travel with ease and make new friends while travelling. The app connects users with a car and users who need a ride. Either driver or the user can post the details of the ride and the interested ones can reply to the post. I am responsible for Front-end and Devops of the application which will be deployed on  AWS.
